# Bash-Scripts

This script is for Linux OS's only.

This script automates some simple maintanance tasks that are very repetitive. 
To run it, you must insert your own password into the script. (Not very secure I know)
Go into the terminal, cd into the directory where the script is stored.
Type sudo chmod +x shine.sh   
Enter your password when prompted
the file is now executable
From now on, all you have to do is make sure you are in that directory and type ./shine.sh
hit enter and all of the cleanup tasks will be performed without prompting you to do any more.
